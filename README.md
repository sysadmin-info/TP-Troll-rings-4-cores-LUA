The theme was modified to adapt it to modern conky configuration requirements.

I took it from ArcoLinux, however I guess it has been downloaded and modified from here: https://www.deviantart.com/trollpunny/art/Conky-Rings-Revamped-591137228

Here you have the list of all conkyrs which comes from the ArcoLInux: https://gitlab.com/rzn/arcolinux-conky-collection/-/tree/master/etc/skel/.config/conky

Dependencies:
* conky
* git to clone the resource
* The theme requires conky-lua. Install it first. 
* Also, download and install Santana font. https://www.dafont.com/santana.font
